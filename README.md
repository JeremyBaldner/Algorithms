# Algorithms
A review of data structures for my C++ project. The project is to read a file and store course information for the advising team to use.
## What I learned
**1.	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?** <br>
The projects for this course solved the problem of which data structure would be best to hold information about school courses. <br><br>
**2.	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.** <br>
I approached the problem by analyzing the data structures that would be appropriate to hold this information and determine which <br> structure is best.
The data structures analyzed were vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. These are important to understand <br> because each have their use cases
and understanding what they are best for can prevent future issues.<br><br>
**3.	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**<br>
I utilized my resources such as Zybooks, stack overflow, and GeeksForGeeks. <br><br>
**4.	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**<br>
This project has helped me better understand time and space complexities. Designing software and developing programs with <br>appropriate data structures
can prevent future issues with that.<br><br>
**5.	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**<br>
Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is important for long term success. Analyzing data structures <br>can help make the best
choice and prevent the need for large changes to data structure types.
